# Agglomerative-Hierarchical-Clustering
This repository implements Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering from scratch  
Steps:
- Preparing the data

- Computing (dis)similarity information between every pair of objects in the data set.

- Using linkage function to group objects into hierarchical cluster tree, based on the distance information generated at step 1. Objects/clusters that are in close proximity are linked together using the linkage function.

- Determining where to cut the hierarchical tree into clusters. This creates a partition of the data.
